    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Download the [biodiversity.zip](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/paths/data-science/biodiversity-starter.zip?_gl=1*1da6440*_gcl_au*NTEwNzU2OTkwLjE3NDYxMDUyNjk.*_ga*MTc5MTQ4OTgwMy4xNzMwMzc2Mzgy*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*czE3NDc4MjM5NTUkbzExNSRnMCR0MTc0NzgyMzk1NSRqNjAkbDAkaDAkZGUxWFdubEpNc3dUQnNyUW42YXl6SVhaN2ljT3hwdjMyNGc.).**  \n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **Unzip the folder** by double-clicking on it. The extracted directory should contain:\n",
    "   - 📄 `Observations.csv` – Contains species observations.\n",
    "   - 📄 `Species_info.csv` – Information about different species.\n",
    "   - 📄 `Biodiversity.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook file for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **Open a command line terminal** and navigate into the unzipped directory:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd path/to/unzipped-folder\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ **Start Jupyter Notebook** by running the following command:  \n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This will launch Jupyter in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣ **Open the notebook** by clicking on `Biodiversity.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface. This will load the workspace where the analysis will be conducted.\n",
