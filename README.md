# 🏞 **Biodiversity in National Parks**  
🔍 Data Analysis on Endangered Species for the National Park Service  

## 📌 **Project Description**
This project analyzes biodiversity data from the **National Park Service**, focusing on endangered species across various parks.  
By performing **data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization**, we investigate patterns in conservation statuses and assess trends affecting different species groups.  

📊 The findings help inform conservation strategies, guiding decisions for protecting vulnerable species.  

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**
- ✅ Complete a **data analysis project** for portfolio development.  
- ✅ Use **Jupyter Notebook** to explore, clean, and visualize biodiversity data.  
- ✅ Conduct **statistical testing** (chi-square analysis) to assess conservation patterns.  
- ✅ Develop **visualizations** with **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to enhance data storytelling.  
- ✅ Communicate insights effectively through **structured reporting and presentations**.

## 📂 **Dataset Overview**
This project relies on **two primary datasets** from the National Park Service:  

1️⃣ **species_info.csv** → Contains species names, categories, and conservation statuses.  
2️⃣ **observations.csv** → Records **species sightings** in various national parks over the past 7 days.  

💡 These datasets help determine which species are **at risk** and whether species categories impact conservation status.  

---

## 🔬 **Analysis Breakdown**
📊 **Key Questions Explored:**  
- Are certain **species categories more endangered** than others?  
- What conservation trends exist among **birds, mammals, and vascular plants**?  
- Do **species observations correlate** with conservation status?  
- How can **sample size determination** improve epidemiological studies (e.g., foot and mouth disease monitoring)?  

📌 **Techniques Applied:**  
- **Data Cleaning & Wrangling** → Handling missing values & formatting.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Generating summary statistics & visualization.  
- **Statistical Significance Testing** → **Chi-Square analysis** to assess species distribution patterns.  
- **Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Clear, structured graphical insights.  
- **Slide Deck for Communication** → Presenting findings in an accessible format.  

---

## 🚀 **Prerequisites**
To successfully execute this project, familiarity with the following topics is recommended:  

✅ **Data Acquisition & Wrangling** → Using Pandas for cleaning and manipulation.  
✅ **Data Visualization** → Creating plots with Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
✅ **Hypothesis Testing** → Statistical significance with chi-square tests.  
✅ **Summarizing Quantitative Data** → Computing distributions and relationships in biodiversity data.
